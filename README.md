# Cosmic Space Lottery 

## Introduction
 
Welcome to Cosmic Space Lottery, a lottery game set in the far reaches of space.

59 numbers are picked at random by the lottery, and you can pick 6 balls, to meteor into space and win out of this world prizes. You can pick your own numbers, or if you want you can leave it up to the space gods and try your hand at a lucky dip.

I have created documentation on how I created the project and what I may do if I had more time. This can be found **[here](https://github.com/StefEmp/CosmicSpaceLottery/blob/main/Cosmic%20Space%20Lottery%20-%20Documentation.pdf)**.

This game has been created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, Handlebars and BootStrap.
