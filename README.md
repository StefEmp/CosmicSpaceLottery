# Cosmic Space Lottery 

## Introduction
 
Welcome to Cosmic Space Lottery, a lottery game set in the far reaches of space.

59 numbers are picked at random by the lottery, you pick 6 balls, which may lead to you meteoring into outer space and winning out of this world prizes. You can pick your own numbers, or if you want, you can leave it up to the space gods and try your hand at a lucky dip.

## Documentation

I have created documentation on how I created the project and what I would do if I were to continue working on the application in the future. This can be found **[here](https://github.com/StefEmp/CosmicSpaceLottery/blob/main/Cosmic%20Space%20Lottery%20-%20Documentation.pdf)**.

This game was created using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express, Handlebars and BootStrap.
